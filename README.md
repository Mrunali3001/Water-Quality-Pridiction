# Water Quality Pridiction

The Water Quality Prediction project aimed to analyze the safety of water samples using machine learning. Using Python and libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn, I performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and applied classification algorithms to predict whether a water sample is safe or not based on various chemical properties. The model helped in identifying key factors affecting water quality and achieved accurate prediction results
